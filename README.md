Password validation in Python

Letâ€™s take a password as a combination of alphanumeric characters along with 
special characters, and check whether the password is valid or not with the help of few conditions.

Conditions for a valid password are:

1. Should have at least one number.
2. Should have at least one uppercase and one lowercase character.
3. Should have at least one special symbol.
4. Should be between 6 to 20 characters long.
